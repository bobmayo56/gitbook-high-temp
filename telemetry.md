# Telemetry

Mostly we need to communicate to the surface, but there are other cases. There may be a need for local \(1 meter?\) communication between drill string components. If there is a hot area as well as a cold area inside of a flask/Dewar, there may be a need for communication between them, perhaps in the 1cm to 2cm range.
