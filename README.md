# Introduction

Here I've gathered some information about high temperature electronics and sensing \(200°C to 500°C\) and it's application to geothermal energy.

I'm approaching this from a non-expert who wants an answer to the following question: "What technologies are needed to build a deep, hot, dry, geothermal well". 

What is missing, and is there any way to help the process, either technically or through greater public awareness?
