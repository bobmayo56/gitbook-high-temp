# Introduction

These are my thoughts on high temperature electronics \(200°C to 500°C\). 

I'm approaching this from a non-expert viewpoint with an eye on geothermal use. What are technologies are needed to build a deep, hot, dry, geothermal well, as described in a Vox article \([https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical)\) and the US Government GeoVision project \([https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geovision](https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geovision)\)?
