# Sensors

Various notes on high temperature sensors. There are a few sub-pages on specific topics.

Some notes:

US Department of Energy: "Advanced Sensors and Instrumentation \(ASI\) includes research to develop advanced sensors, instrumentation and controls that address critical technology gaps for monitoring and controlling existing and advanced reactors and supporting fuel cycle development. " -- [https://www.energy.gov/ne/nuclear-energy-enabling-technologies/advanced-sensors-and-instrumentation](https://www.energy.gov/ne/nuclear-energy-enabling-technologies/advanced-sensors-and-instrumentation)

"In [control engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_engineering) applications, it is common to have a sensing stage \(which consists of a [sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor)\), a signal conditioning stage \(where usually amplification of the signal is done\) and a processing stage \(often carried out by an [ADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter) and a [micro-controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-controller)\). [Operational amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifiers) \(op-amps\) are commonly employed to carry out the amplification of the signal in the signal conditioning stage." -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal\_conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_conditioning)
