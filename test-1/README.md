# Drilling Electronics

Various thoughts on drilling electronics. This section also contains separate sub-pages with details.

Some quotes:

"Tools that we build don't exceed 175C. I believe that is the generally accepted hottest we need for US wells. I have seen a few 200C designs but they are so cost prohibitive they are rarely used" -- personal communication from someone in the drilling industry, November 2020.

"In [control engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_engineering) applications, it is common to have a sensing stage \(which consists of a [sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor)\), a signal conditioning stage \(where usually amplification of the signal is done\) and a processing stage \(often carried out by an [ADC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter) and a [micro-controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-controller)\). [Operational amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifiers) \(op-amps\) are commonly employed to carry out the amplification of the signal in the signal conditioning stage." -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal\_conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_conditioning)
