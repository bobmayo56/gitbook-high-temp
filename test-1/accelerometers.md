# Accelerometers

"An **accelerometer** is a tool that measures [proper acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer#cite_note-Tinder-1) Proper acceleration is the [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration) \(the [rate of change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_change_%28mathematics%29) of [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity)\) of a body in its own instantaneous [rest frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_frame)" -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer)

There seems to be research on SiC 400C - 600C accelerometers.
