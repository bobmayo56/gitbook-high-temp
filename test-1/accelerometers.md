# Accelerometers

"An **accelerometer** is a tool that measures [proper acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer#cite_note-Tinder-1) Proper acceleration is the [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration) \(the [rate of change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_change_%28mathematics%29) of [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity)\) of a body in its own instantaneous [rest frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_frame)" -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer)

There seems to be research on SiC 400C - 600C accelerometers. 'Fabrication of SiC/Si Hybrid Accelerometer for High Temperature Applications", [https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Fabrication-of-SiC%2FSi-Hybrid-Accelerometer-for-High-Chand/25f5fcbf668102155f08ac246a45fd9d2586cd54](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Fabrication-of-SiC%2FSi-Hybrid-Accelerometer-for-High-Chand/25f5fcbf668102155f08ac246a45fd9d2586cd54)

Also some GaN work. "Inertial sensing technologies in high temperature environments over 500Â°C are in great demand in aerospace, power plants and material processing applications." "GaN based MEMS accelerometer for high temperature application", [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018APS..MART60359A/abstract](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018APS..MART60359A/abstract)
