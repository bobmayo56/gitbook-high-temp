Model: 176M09 from PCB Piezoelectronics. [https://www.pcb.com/products?m=176M09](https://www.pcb.com/products?m=176M09)  \(Sensor appears to work to 530C, but "receptacle" only goes to 260C\). 

"The "IMPACT" series of Gefran are pressure transmitters, without transmission fluid, for using in high temperature environment \(350°C\)." -- [https://www.gefran.com/en/products/226-in-impact-fluid-free-voltage-output](https://www.gefran.com/en/products/226-in-impact-fluid-free-voltage-output)

"Our Quartz technology, combined with our expertise in high temperature circuits and custom ASICs, provides an unmatched pressure and temperature sensor for downhole oil and gas." -- [http://www.quartzdyne.com](http://www.quartzdyne.com)

"The base technology used in designing and fabricating the Sandia Quartz Resonator Pressure Gauges for geothermal well logging is presented. The following topics are treated: resonator design \(crystallographic orientation\), transducer design \(static stress analysis and transfer function\), electrode technology, and assembly details. In addition, preliminary results of pressure measurements at 275°C are presented." -- [https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6436152](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6436152) \(1979\)
