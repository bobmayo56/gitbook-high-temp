# Pressure Sensors

"Our Quartz technology, combined with our expertise in high temperature circuits and custom ASICs, provides an unmatched pressure and temperature sensor for downhole oil and gas." -- [http://www.quartzdyne.com](http://www.quartzdyne.com)

"The base technology used in designing and fabricating the Sandia Quartz Resonator Pressure Gauges for geothermal well logging is presented. The following topics are treated: resonator design \(crystallographic orientation\), transducer design \(static stress analysis and transfer function\), electrode technology, and assembly details. In addition, preliminary results of pressure measurements at 275°C are presented." -- [https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6436152](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6436152) \(1979\)

"tools that we build don't exceed 175C. I believe that is the generally accepted hottest we need for US wells. I have seen a few 200C designs but they are so cost prohibitive they are rarely used" -- personal communication from someone in the drilling industry
