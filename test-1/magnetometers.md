# Magnetometers

"A **magnetometer** is a device that measures [magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism)â€”the direction, strength, or relative change of a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field) at a particular location." -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer)

"A fluxgate magnetometer consists of a small magnetically susceptible core wrapped by two coils of wire" -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer\#Fluxgate\_magnetometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer#Fluxgate_magnetometer)
