# Drilling

This is about drilling deep, hot, dry geothermal wells.

"Tools that we build don't exceed 175C. I believe that is the generally accepted hottest we need for US wells. I have seen a few 200C designs but they are so cost prohibitive they are rarely used" -- personal communication from someone in the drilling industry, November 2020. \(presumed focus on oil and gas\)
