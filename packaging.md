# Packaging

## Questions

* NASA Glenn is using 96% aluminum oxide with thick film gold? LTCC or HTCC? Isn't firing temperature too high? Can boards in this process be obtained commercially?

## Notes

"The ceramic chip-level packages used for the NASA chips have been reported previously \[8, 36–39\]. The ceramic packaging material was 96% aluminum oxide \(Al2O3\) substrate and Au thick-film metallization. The SiC devices were electrically connected to each package’s eight input/output terminals via 1 mil diameter Au wires. Chip packages were then attached to a ceramic printed circuit board also utilizing a 96% Al2O3 substrate and Au thick- film metallization." \[1\]
