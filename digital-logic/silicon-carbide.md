NASA Glenn is working on 4-bit ADC, 4-bit DAC, Op Amps, 4x4 static RAM, Source Separation Sensor Signal Transmitter, Ring Oscillators, Binary Amplitude Modulation RF Transmitter. \[1\]

Is NASA Glenn working on bandgap reference, a resonator, a ROM, or digital components that can be used for a microcontroller?

High-temperature voltage and current references  have been designed in a silicon carbide CMOS process \[4\]
