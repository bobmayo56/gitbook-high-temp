Some technologies, like Silicon Carbide, are not fully developed and are restricted to a small number of transistors per chip, perhaps 1,000. It is useful to compare with technology of the 1970s where silicon was at this stage.

The Apollo Guidance Computer represented the state of the art when it was first built, in 1966. "The Block II version of the AGC which was used in the actual manned flights contained some 2,800 ICs, each of which contained two NOR3 gates \(that is, a three-input logic gate implementing the [Not OR function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_NOR)\) using [resistor-transistor logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor-transistor_logic) \(an early type of digital circuit that was phased out due to high power consumption\) .. An RTL NOR3 gate, as seen in the above picture, requires three transistors. That means 6 transistors per IC or about _10,000 transistors_ total to make up the Apollo Guidance Computer."

It seems reasonable to conclude that something with the capabilities of the Apollo Guidance Computer could be built today out of Silicon Carbide ICs, as they are much denser than the two NOR3 gates used in the Apollo computer.

The MOS Technology 6502 had about _3,510 transistors_. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS\_Technology\_6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502)

The Intel 8085 had about _6,500 transistors_. Similar chips with this architecture are still used in new designs today for 200C control applications. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel\_8085](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8085)
